# Candy-Crush-Clone
A Candy Crush-style game built entirely in C++ with no external graphics libraries. This project, created as a first-semester student assignment along with my fellow Nigarish Naseem, lets players match candies in a fun and addictive puzzle game using simple console graphics.
For best experience its better to first set your terminal colour to a baby pink one.
The game will show the graphics correctly only if you use the given help.h file as the graphic file.
